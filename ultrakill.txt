Q: What kind of enemies are in the game?
A: There is a vast catalogue of enemies in ULTRAKILL. Each enemy falls under a classification or catagory. There are Husks, Demons, Machines, and Angels. While these 4 classifications don't do much except give you an idea of what the enemy is capable of, these classes are split further into strength categories. These are Lesser, Greater, and Supreme. Lesser enemies are typically fodder, though they may appear in swarms or come as support for more dangerous enemies. Greater enemies are, of course, much more dangerous, being a bulk of the trouble one may face in the game aside from Supreme enemies and bosses. Supreme enemies are the real deal in ULTRAKILL. While a majority of these enemies are bosses, a few appear as common enemies later on. These enemies are very dangerous and often require the full attention of most players in order to defeat, making stages where they appear with support a real hassle.

Q: What is the lore behind ULTRAKILL?
A: ULTRAKILL follows the journey of a machine, V1, as they venture into the depths of Hell after humanity's extinction. While the cause of mankind's fall is unclear, various terminals scattered around levels indicate that Hell used its energy to make the machines humanity built during the Final War to turn on their masters. After wiping humanity, it is implied that the machines, unsatiated by their newfound lust for blood, ventured into Hell to kill its denizens. Which brings us to the beginning, V1 falling into the entrance of Hell, and the game begins. As V1 ventures through Hell, killing Husks, Demons, and bloodthirsty machines, he acquires a huge arsenal of weapons and begins pushing deeper into Hell, killing anyone in the process. No one, from a stray Filth to Archangel Gabriel, is spared from the slaughter.

Q: How do you get alternate weapon variants in ULTRAKILL?
A: You can unlock each of the 3 alternate weapon variants by completing the mini quest tied to each one. For the Alternate Revolver, you must find 3 slab-shaped buttons around the 4 levels of Limbo. After pressing all 4 and going to the large vault door to the left of the hallway intersection will give you the Alternate (Slab) Revolver. For the Alternate Shotgun, you need to find 3 slabs located around the Violence Layer. Each slab is able to be pressed after completing a timed course to reach each slabs. After reaching a door on 7-2; LIGHT UP THE NIGHT that is located at a train checkpoint in a building with a hole in the roof, you can open the door after the slabs have been pressed. There you will obtain the Jackhammer. The alternate Nailgun can be obtained in 4-4: CLAIR DE SOLEIL, when you use the Electric Railcannon on a pool of water by firing it through a crack in a doorway. This will open another door near you, where you can walk in to see the Corpse of King Sisyphus, and the Sawblade Launcher for you to take. 

Q: How is the Alternate Revolver different from the normal Pistol?
A: The Alternate Revolver is different in a few ways. The Slab Revolver, for one, fires 2 hitscan shots with one attack, and has a noticible cooldown between primary fires. While it fires 2 bullets per shot, each of which deal more damage, it has a significant cooldown between primary shots. The charge shot, charges similarly to the Pistols, however, the Slab Revolver fires 6, 1.25 damage shots with its Charge Shot, compared to the default Pistol's 3, 1 damage shots. Plus, the Slab Revolver recharges its Charge Shot twice as slowly as the normal Pistol. 

Q: How is the Alternate Shotgun different from the normal Shotgun?
A: The Jackhamemr is very different from the Shotgun. For starters, the Jackhammer is a pseudo-melee weapon, as it does not fire shotgun shells. Instead, you charge the Jackhammer by holding down primary fire, however, damage dealt is not based on how long you charge the Jackhammer. Damage dealt is based on how fast you are moving. The Jackhammer combines the game's fast paced movement with the Jackhammer's damage mechanic to deal more damage the faster you are moving. Thus, it is best to charge the Jackhammer, and charge an enemy at full speed and let them have it with a powerful blow to their body. 

Q: How is the Alternate Nailgun different from the normal Nailgun?
A: The Sawblade Launcher, similarly to the Slab Revolver, resembles its default counterpart, while maintaining enough differences to be its own unique weapon. The Sawblade Launcher, unlike the Nailgun, holds 10 large saws in its reserves as opposed to 100 nails. These fly out and deal moderate damage, higher than individual nails, however, at a slower speed than the nailgun launcher. The main utility of this weapon however, similar to the Nailgun, is the magnets it can fire with its secondary fire. These magnets stick to most surfaces. While the nails from the Nailgun will automatically track the nearest magnet to them, sawblades will orbit magnets at a rapid speed, forming something called a "Sawblade Trap" if you use a few sawblades. These, unlike nails, can be used as large area denial against groups of enemies, as opposed to the Nailgun, which is used to deal rapid single target damage against a certain enemy. 

Q: How does the Pistol work?
A: The default Pistol, excluding variants, fires a singe shot every 0.5 seconds or so, dealing 1 damager per shot. It is a standard issue pistol that you recieve when beginning the game in the level 0-1: INTO THE FIRE. The Charge Shot fires 3 piercing shots that deal 1 damage each. It is typically used to clear out a small group of enemies, but may not always deal good/consistent damage to tankier or more mobile enemies. 

Q: How does the Shotgun work?
A: The base Shotgun is unlocked after you beat the Swordsmachine boss in 0-3: DOUBLE DOWN (earlier in 0-2: THE MEATGRINDER if you find the secret encounter). It is a futuristic, double-barreled, break-action shotgun. It can fire a singe shot of 12 shotgun shells every 1.25 seconds with each pellet dealing 0.25 damage (3 damage total with every pellet landing). Since the shotgun shells count as projectiles, parrying after shooting your shotgun will cause you to punch your own shotgun bullet (+PROJECTILE BOOST) and turn it into a hitscan that deals explosive damage upon contact with a surface or enemy. Alt fire will launch the shotguns core out in front of you, exploding upon contact with a surface or enemy. Charging alt fire will send the core further. While good for clearing out groups of enemies and dealing solid damage against tanky targets, certain enemies are resistant against explosions, causing them to be resistant against Projectile Boosts and core launches. 

Q: How does the Nailgun work?
A: The Nailgun is unlocked in the level 1-1: HEART OF THE SUNRISE. It holds 100 nails in its reserve. It rapidly fires these nails at a rate of 25 nails per second, meaning you will run out of nails after 4 seconds of continuous fire. Nails regenerate at a rate of 5 nails per second, thus, you will regain all your nails after about 20 seconds, though you can fire the weapon as long as you have nails in your reserve. Each nail does 0.205 damage. Combining that with the rapid rate of fire yields around 5.125 damage per second, assuming all nails hit. This makes the nailgun extremely powerful for single target combat. Alt fire will launch a magnet rod out in front of you magnets can stick to surfaces and enemies. Magnets are capable of attracting a variety of things, from nails to rockets from the rocket launcher. Nails that pass close to a magnet will automatically be attracted to it, embedding themselves into an enemy if they come into contact with one. Nails also have a unique interaction with the Electric Railcannon. Electrifying an enemy with the railcannon while they have nails lodged in them will cause the nails to explode, dealing 0.06 damage per exploded nail. 

Q: How does the Railcannon work?
A: The Railcannon is unlocked in the level
